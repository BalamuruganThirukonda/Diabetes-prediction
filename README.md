## Installation

### Prerequisites
To use this project, you need to install the following software and libraries:
- Python (version >= 3.11.5)
- Git (for version control)
- A virtual environment manager (e.g., `virtualenv`)

### Setting Up the Project

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/project_name.git
    cd project_name
    ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # For macOS/Linux
    venv\Scripts\activate     # For Windows
    ```

3. **Install the required dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

### How to run the code:
- The main code for training the model is located in `src/model.py`. To train the model, run:
    ```bash
    python src/model.py
    ```

- For data preprocessing, you can use the functions in `src/preprocessing.py`. To use them, import and call them in your scripts or notebooks.

### Jupyter Notebooks:
- You can explore the analysis and model training in the provided Jupyter notebook `notebooks/analysis.ipynb`.
    To run the notebook, execute:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook notebooks/analysis.ipynb
    ```

## Data

- The dataset used in this project is stored under the `data/` directory. It is divided into:
    - `raw/`: Raw, unprocessed data files.
    - `processed/`: Cleaned and transformed data files ready for analysis.
  
### Data Description:
- Provide details about your dataset (e.g., features, number of rows, source of the data).
  
For example:
```markdown
The dataset consists of customer information from an e-commerce platform, with features like age, gender, and transaction history.
